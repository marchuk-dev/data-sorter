**Overview**

This project contains a method for sorting dates according to a specific order. The sorting criteria are as follows:
1. Dates with an 'r' in the month should come first, sorted in ascending order (from earliest to latest).
2. Dates without an 'r' in the month should follow, sorted in descending order (from latest to earliest).

For instance, dates in October should appear before dates in May because October contains an 'r'.
